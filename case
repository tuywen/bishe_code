36 18.0 20041113p014001
for most kashmiris who have been fed up with the stiffening of indian and pakistan approaches on kashmir, this appears to be the right argument.

37 18.0 20041119p009001

india accuses pakistan of arming muslim insurgents fighting for the region's independence or merger with islamic pakistan.

53 14.2 20041113p010001
patil was obviously trying to suggest that the prime minister singh had taken the decision to reduce the troops inside kashmir on his own.

54 14.2 20041119p013001
pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz is due to make his first trip to india next week since taking office in august, and will hold talks with singh.

some migrated in the aftermath of the bloody partition of the subcontinent in 1947, many more fled to the pakistani side when a separatist insurgency took hold in the indian portion of kashmir in 1989.

60 12.0 20050408p006001

61 12.0 20041123p017001

a third round of talks with india's government can't start until it agrees to let kashmiri leaders visit pakistan to discuss peace proposals with its government and guerrilla commanders in the part of kashmir under pakistan's control, farooq said.

65 12.0 20041118p007001
the pakistani and indian portions of kashmir are separated by a heavily militarized cease-fire line where skirmishes were once common between their forces.

66 12.0 20041118p011001
the two countries are due to start formal talks on kashmir next month, and people on both sides are eager for a long-standing proposal for a bus service between muzaffarabad and srinagar, the summer capital of indian-held kashmir, to finally get off the ground.

67 12.0 20041119h001001
pakistan plays down indian premier's comments on kashmir solution

68 12.0 20041119p007003
we are asking for a solution that is acceptable to the people of pakistan, india and the kashmiris."

69 12.0 20050312p004001
the bus service is the first tangible result of 14 months of  dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours who have fought three  wars including two over kashmir, which each hold in part but claim  in full.

70 11.2 20041118p004001
singh's two-day trip came as india began withdrawing some of its troops on the border, a goodwill gesture to war-weary kashmiris and rival pakistan.

71 11.2 20041113p012003
significantly, musharraf had suggested withdrawal of indian troops from kashmir region.

72 11.0 20041113p011003
that is why the prime minister has said that together with the reduction in the number of troops in kashmir, there would be no lowering of vigil.

73 11.0 20041118p008003
india accuses pakistan of helping foment it, which pakistan denies.

74 11.0 20050312p010001
indian authorities last week said some 150 permits had been  issued to applicants from indian-kashmir to travel by the bus  linking srinagar to muzaffarabad, capital of the  pakistan-administered zone.

75 10.2 20041123p002001
pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz arrived here tuesday on a tour of regional capitals as head of the south asian association for regional cooperation, which promotes closer economic ties within the region.

76 9.0 20050312p006001
the bus service was suspended in 1947 after the first  india-pakistan war over kashmir.

77 8.0 20050408p013001

80 8.0 20041118p014001

81 8.0 20041123p007001
indian security forces said they were winning a war against the separatists in kashmir, which began in 1989.

82 8.0 20041123p010002
but as the guerrillas lose their strength, pakistan loses leverage on the kashmir issue.

83 8.0 20041123p018001
pakistan will only drop its demand for a vote ``if india is prepared to show flexibility,'' musharraf told an interviewer last week, adding that ``at the moment ... we don't see that.''

85 8.0 20050321p004001
pakistan's foreign ministry spokesman jalil abbas jilani said pakistani and indian officials will on tuesday exchange lists of passengers for the first buses.

86 8.0 20041113p005001
this measure has obviously been taken to take care of the building tensions between the indian army and local people who often come into unpleasant contact during encounters, crackdown operations and search and cordon exercises that have become so routine in kashmir ever since the present armed struggle against the indian rule started here 18 years back.

87 8.0 20041113p006001
it must also be mentioned that the indian army on friday suspended and took into custody an officer who had been accused of having raped a woman and her daughter in a north kashmir village last week.

88 8.0 20041113p008001
coinciding with the announcement made in the indian capital new delhi, indian paramilitary police was battling it out with two suicide guerrillas that forced entry into their camp in srinagar' s dalgate area on the banks of the dal lake that is regarded as one of the most secured places in kashmir and the hub of the tourist activity in kashmir.

90 8.0 20041118p006002
indian soldiers were preventing people from getting too close, and on the pakistan side, police said authorities had not given formal permission for the reunions.

91 8.0 20050312p007001
indian kashmir is in the grip of a 15-year-old insurgency that  has so far left thousands dead.

92 7.2 20041118p009002

93 7.2 20041118p016001

94 7.2 20041123p008002
the number climbed in recent weeks as musharraf pressed singh to move more quickly on negotiations over kashmir.

95 7.2 20041118p003001
kashmiri leader mirwaiz omar farooq insisted thursday that ``historic realities,'' such as a guerrilla war against indian rule that began in 1989, meant three-way talks were the only way to end the dispute over the divided territory.

96 7.2 20041119p003001
pakistan's foreign ministry spokesman masood khan said that singh's comments did not necessarily represent an intractable position.

so, it seems, is the u.s. food and drug administration, which is stalling a decision on whether to make the morning-after pill available nationwide without a prescription.

1 14 20050303p001001
nearly one-third of sexually active  portuguese girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have taken the  "morning-after" pill to prevent pregnancy, according to a study  published thursday in the daily publico.

2 13 20041017p002001
ultimately, it will be up to food and drug administration officials to decide: should older teens be able to buy emergency contraception without a prescription?

3 13 20041025p004003
so earlier this year, when a food and drug administration panel recommended that emergency contraception be available without a prescription, a top agency official overruled the scientists.

4 13 20050107p001001
nine women protesting the food and drug administration's position on the emergency contraceptive plan b were arrested friday when they blocked entry to the agency's rockville, md., headquarters.

5 13 20050116p002001
fierce arguments have gone on inside and outside the food and drug administration, which may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the emergency contraception known as plan b without a prescription to women age 16 and older.

6 11 20041017p001001
some see easy access to emergency contraception as a way to drastically reduce teen pregnancy, already on the decline in the united states since the early 1990s.

7 11 20041017p013001
a stronger dose of regular hormonal contraception, the morning-after pill can prevent pregnancy by delaying a woman's ovulation or keeping sperm from fertilizing an egg.

8 11 20041017p016001
"emergency contraception is not true contraception," says sierra correa, the 22-year-old vice president of collegians for life, a student group that opposes the morning-after pill.

9 11 20041017p018001
the study, published in the april issue of the journal of pediatric and adolescent gynecology, found that teens who had emergency contraception on hand were not more likely to have unprotected sex.

10 11 20041130p003002
the definition in the bill of emergency contraceptives, commonly called the morning-after pill, also fits some nonemergency contraceptives, or birth-control pills.

11 11 20041130p011001
the morning-after pill is a higher dose of regular hormonal contraception that works to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after intercourse.

12 11 20050104p001001
providing women with easy access to the emergency contraceptive plan b did not lead them to engage in more risky sexual behavior, a study of more than 2,000 young california women has concluded.

13 10 20050128p006002
twelve states now allow pharmacists who oppose contraception to refuse to fill prescriptions for birth control, including the ``morning-after pill.''

14 10 20050128p007005
omitted from the final version was draft language about the effectiveness of emergency contraception in preventing pregnancy.

15 10 20050104p011001
the medical profession does not consider emergency contraception to be an abortion pill like ru-486, or mifeprex, because plan b works by preventing a pregnancy from starting rather than ending an existing one.

16 9 20041025p004002
no surprise then that the administration argues that allowing adolescents easy access to the morning-after pill would only confuse its abstinence message.

17 9 20050107p002001
the women, part of a noisy protest in favor of making the morning-after pill available without a prescription, were taken away by officers of the department of homeland security and charged with disorderly conduct.

18 9 20050104p002002
the findings led the study authors to conclude that easy access to plan b, also called the morning-after pill, could cut the number of unwanted pregnancies while posing no apparent risk to women.

19 8 20041017h001001
amid debate, fda considers teen access to emergency contraception

20 8 20041017p005001
such access, some argue, would make it easier to get emergency contraception on evenings and weekends, allowing more women to take it in the recommended 72-hour window after unprotected sex.

21 8 20041025p005001
a recent study by the university of pittsburgh medical school found that teens who had emergency contraception on hand were not more likely to have unprotected sex.

22 8 20050107p013001
studies have shown that emergency contraception works for about 72 hours after unprotected sex but is best used within 24 hours.

23 8 20050107p015001
``acog and other organizations have estimated that greater access to emergency contraceptives could cut the u.s. unintended pregnancy and abortion rates in half,'' the group said in a statement.

24 8 20050104p003001
the study contradicts a key claim made by opponents of easier access to plan b at a time when the food and drug administration is preparing to decide on a second application to allow nonprescription sales of the drug.

25 7 20050116p001001
the u.s. government is considering whether to make morning-after birth control available without a prescription, and like most issues that involve sex and pregnancy, it has generated heated debate.

26 6 20041017p007002
she asked that her name not be used because her parents don't know she used the morning-after pill in april.

27 6 20041017p017001
some opponents also have argued that easier access to the morning-after pill would make teens more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior _ though some doctors say that research done at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine casts doubt on that argument.

28 6 20050128p008001
the morning-after pill acts by impeding ovulation, fertilization and implantation.

29 6 20041130p008001
in january, pharmacists at an eckerd drug store in denton denied a morning-after pill to a rape victim.

30 6 20041130p012001
when the bill's language is refined, it should only refer to the morning-after pill, said state rep. charles hopson, d-jacksonville.

31 6 20050303h001001
one-third of teenage girls in portugal have taken morning-after  pill: study

32 6 20050116p019001
the morning-after pill is a higher dose of the contraceptive hormones found in the pill.

33 6 20050116p020001
because medical experts do not consider a woman to be pregnant until after an egg implants into the uterus, the morning-after pill is not considered abortion, although some conservatives object to any interference with a fertilized egg.

34 6 20050116p021001
if a woman already is pregnant, morning-after pills have no effect.

35 5 20041011p003001
mazzetti said the pill, which contains the hormone levonorgestrel and is sold in lima pharmacies under the brand-name postinor-2, prevents pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation.

36 5 20041017p003001
earlier this year, the fda denied one drug company's request to sell its brand of emergency contraception to anyone.

37 5 20041017p008002
she says the topic of unplanned pregnancy and emergency contraception comes up with her patients nearly every day.

38 5 20041017p008003
but few want to discuss it with their parents _ or use insurance to buy emergency contraception out of fear their parents will find out.

39 5 20041017p010001
however, a physician who opposes over-the-counter sale of emergency contraception fears that young women would skip regular visits to the gynecologist if they didn't need to see a doctor to get it.

40 5 20041017p012001
he also says some young women might not want to use emergency contraception if they knew how it worked.

41 5 20041017p014002
that's a major reason anti-abortion groups _ from the american life league to the pro-life action league _ are among emergency contraception's main opponents.

42 5 20041017p018002
it also concluded that those teens were more likely to use emergency contraception correctly and sooner after sex, when it is most effective.

44 5 20041130p001001
the first of possibly several bills seeking to let texas pharmacists "just say no" to filling prescriptions for emergency contraceptives has been filed before the legislative session that begins in january.

45 5 20050211p005002
but we need better choices than those of the moralizing right, whose restrictive policies on sex education, emergency contraception (the morning after pill) and medical care for the working poor force many women to choose between an abortion and rearing a child in poverty.

46 5 20041025p005002
they were, however, more likely to use the drug correctly to prevent pregnancy.

47 5 20050107p003002
fda staff reviewers and an advisory panel of outside experts had strongly recommended approval, saying the emergency contraceptive could be safely sold without a prescription.

48 5 20050107p011001
the bush administration has been cool to the expanded use of emergency contraception, which some conservatives see as a form of abortion.

49 5 20050107p011002
this week, the justice department issued guidelines for treating rape victims that make no mention of emergency contraception, leading to criticism from women's health groups and others that a standard precaution for rape victims was being ignored.

50 5 20050116p005001
plan b can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex.

51 5 20050116p016001
last may, the fda rejected nonprescription sales of emergency contraception, against the overwhelming recommendation of the agency's own scientific advisers.

52 4 20041011p001001
peru's health minister said monday that government plans to distribute morning-after birth control pills at public health clinics will begin as scheduled in january, despite an attempt by conservative lawmakers in this predominantly roman catholic country to have her prosecuted for promoting abortion.

53 4 20050128p002001
only 40 years ago, within the memory of millions of americans, birth control could not be legally sold in some states, even to married couples.

54 4 20050128p003001
for some bush supporters, religious beliefs about when life begins or about interfering with ``natural law'' justify limiting access to common forms of birth control.

55 4 20041130p008003
in march, a cvs pharmacist in north richland hills refused to fill julee lacey's prescription for birth control pills.

56 4 20041130p009001
the pharmacist told lacey that she did not believe in any form of birth control and advised her to go to a nearby walgreens for assistance, said lacey, of fort worth.

57 4 20050303p002001
the study, one of the largest ever carried out into the  contraceptive habits of portuguese women, also found 16 percent of  all sexually active girls in this age group do not use any form of  birth control at all, the paper said.

58 3 20050128p009002
opponents claim that easy access would encourage promiscuity, despite data to the contrary from states such as california, where the pill is more freely available.

59 3 20041025p004004
in most states the drug has stayed off-limits to everyone -- teens and adults -- who can't get to a doctor within 72 hours after unprotected sex or can't afford one.

60 3 20041025p005003
this study confirms other findings and is one reason why most obstetricians and gynecologists back easy access.

61 3 20050116p014002
women with easy access were more likely to use plan b, leading researchers to conclude that easy access could prevent unwanted pregnancies.

62 3 20050104p002001
the study did find that women given a supply to keep at home were almost twice as likely to use the drug after unprotected sex as those who had to pick it up at a clinic or pharmacy.

63 3 20050104p005001
the fda turned down the initial application last may, saying there wasn't enough information on how easy access would affect the sexual behavior of young teens.

64 3 20050104p008001
the study found that roughly the same percentage of each group had unprotected sex over a six-month period, that incidence of sexually transmitted disease was equal, and that about the same percentage became pregnant.

65 3 20050104p012001
the new study, being published wednesday in the journal of the american medical association, supports the position taken by much of the fda review staff and 23 of 27 members of the fda advisory panel that the drug could be safely and properly used without a prescription.

minister: morning-after pil's distribution to go ahead in peru, despite opposition

67 0 20041011p002001
"the decision is made and there is no turning back," health minister pilar mazzetti told reporters.

68 0 20041011p002002
"this is not based on personal beliefs, but in technical and scientific studies that show the pill is not abortive."

69 0 20041011p004001
to be effective, it must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse.

70 0 20041011p005001
last week three conservative legislators denounced mazzetti for "lying" when she reported to peru's justice ministry that the pills are not a form of abortion because they cancel a pregnancy before the fertilized egg implants itself in the uterus.

71 0 20041011p006001
the legislators, who argued that life begins upon fertilization, want congress to vote on whether to lift mazzetti's constitutional immunity to face criminal charges.

72 0 20041011p007001
abortion is illegal in peru, except in cases where the mother's life is in danger.

73 0 20041011p008001
"any time one assumes public office there is a risk," mazzetti said.

74 0 20041011p008002
"evidently, in a democratic country, everyone has the liberty to make denunciations and accusations and whatever.

75 0 20041011p008003
if this accusation is presented, the ministry of health will have to back up its decisions."

76 0 20041011p009001
peru's medical board has endorsed mazzetti, and rocio villanueva, peru's deputy human rights ombudsman, said the criminal allegations against mazzetti "have no basis."

77 0 20041017p001002
others worry that its long-term effects on young women are unknown or argue that the drug, also known as the "morning after pill," encourages teens to have sex.

78 0 20041017p003002
now that company, barr pharmaceuticals, has submitted a second proposal _ to sell its plan b brand to people 16 and older, but to require anyone younger than that to consult a physician.

the company expects a decision next year.

80 0 20041017p004001
sale without a prescription have received support from both the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and american medical association.

81 0 20041017p006001
others, including some young women, see it as a way for teens who don't want their parents to know they're having sex to help prevent unwanted pregnancy.

82 0 20041017p007001
"kids are going to end up having kids because they're hiding from their parents; they're too scared to tell them," said a 17-year-old in new york city.

83 0 20041017p008001
the young woman is a patient of dr. bernadith russell, the attending physician at long island hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department who also works in private practice at teen clinics in brooklyn.

84 0 20041017p009001
"i can't begin to say how much of a barrier that is," russell says.

85 0 20041017p011001
"they're not going to get their pap smears; they're not going to get screened for sexually transmitted disease," says dr. gene rudd, a gynecologist who serves as associate executive director of the tennessee-based christian medical association.

86 0 20041017p014001
it also can thin the uterus lining, making it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant.

87 0 20041017p015001
while many in the medical field do not share their view, they see interfering with a fertilized egg as abortion.

88 0 20041017p016002
"drug companies have been getting away with calling it contraception by redefining pregnancy to mean implantation" of a fertilized egg.

89 0 20041017p019001
each year, there are about 3 million unintended pregnancies _ and in about 800,000 of those cases the parents are teenagers, according to the federal centers for disease control.

if president bush and his allies in congress are successful, the future could look much like that past.

the motivation for others may be disapproval of sex outside of marriage -- by adults as well as teens.

whatever the impetus, the emerging results are astonishing.

97 0 20050128p004001
as part of abstinence-only sex education, which the president champions and taxpayers now fund to the tune of $170 million annually, u.s. teens are being taught a bunch of hooey.

actually, studies find that condoms are nearly always effective in blocking hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases if used properly (and we hope we don't need to refute the first assertion).

given increasing electric rates, decreasing costs of solar panels and economic incentives available to homeowners through tax credits and rebates, stout expects installations of solar power systems to increase rapidly in the next few years.

1 21.2 20050913p002001
the plant will have 350,000 solar panels spread over 114  hectares (280 acres) near the southern town of moura and will be  able to produce 62 megawatts, more than six times the largest  existing solar power station in germany.

2 18.2 20051020p004001
the ceo of italian train company trenitalia, roberto testore,  said it was "looking with interest to the solar power sector, with a view to producing vehicles on an industrial scale."

3 14.2 20051020p005001

us$54.4 million loan from spain funds philippine solar power project

5 14.2 20050902p001001
spain has provided a us$54.4 million (euro43.4 million) long-term loan to fund a solar power project for remote villages in the central and southern philippines, officials said friday.

6 14.2 20050902p003001
the project will provide electricity for the first time to more than 277,900 rural households, plus schools, potable water systems and health, village and livelihood centers, said dioscora tobias of the government's solar power technology support project.

7 14.2 20050902p005001
tobias, who monitors and evaluates the solar power project, said it also will provide schools in remote areas with television sets and video players to be used as teaching aids.

8 14.2 20050902p006001
a rural household with a solar panel installed typically will have enough electricity to power four light bulbs and backup batteries to provide power for a week of bad weather.

"today is a peak power day," burton said, looking up at a rooftop covered with 80 solar panels.

10 14.2 20051008p005001
lower prices for solar equipment, higher efficiency and tax and rebate incentives from government and utility companies have caused more long islanders to look to lower their energy costs with solar power.

11 14.2 20051008p011001
such a system can reduce electric bills by 20 to 100 percent, according to sharon laudisi of the long island power authority, depending on the amount and duration of sunlight hitting the solar panels and on electricity use in the home.

12 14.2 20050928p002002
with fair  and good incentives we can have solar power competitive in ten  year's time."

13 14.2 20051002p001002
on a day when their morning newspapers reported a projected 70 percent increase in natural gas bills, more than 160 central san joaquin valley residents spent saturday checking out the possibilities of generating their own electricity through solar power.

14 14.2 20051002p004001
neely said that with the possibility of a solar power system paying for itself in fewer years, given the current energy price situation, he and his wife, nola, are seriously considering installing photovoltaic roof panels on their next house.

the first saturday in october was clear, dry and drenched in bright sunlight -- ideal for the solar panels converting light to electricity at harry kubetz and gary burton's home in northport, n.y.

42 10.6 20051008p013001
solar panels do not store energy, and they supply electricity only when the sun is shining on them.

43 10.6 20051008p014001
kubetz and burton like the modern look that the sleek reflective solar panels add to the back of their suburban ranch.

44 10.6 20050909p003002
"as these technologies get better, we're seeing things being developed like solar panels integrated into roofing tiles.

45 10.6 20050909p015002
the most popular means of converting the sun's energy into electricity -- silicon-based solar panels -- has progressed over the last three decades but has not changed radically.

46 10.6 20050909p015004
these form the building blocks for solar panels, which look like big storm windows as they sit atop roofs and soak up the sun.

taiwan has great promise in solar energy development: tycoon

59 9.6 20050926p002001
speaking in an interview with cna, motech industries inc. president leo cheng said he urged the government to invest more in solar energy research when his company began investing in the field seven years ago.

60 9.6 20050926p003002
with this precious asset, i see no other country better equipped than taiwan to develop solar energy," cheng said.

61 9.6 20050926p004001
in the past two years, cheng said, more and more local companies have got involved in solar energy development, enhancing the possibility of forming a comprehensive industry supply chain.

62 9.6 20050926p005001
"so long as we can develop a complete supply chain, the solar energy industry will become yet another of taiwan's star industries like the electronics industry," cheng said.

63 9.6 20050926p014002
as a result, upstream solar energy materials have been in short supply and he predicted that investment in upstream solar energy materials production will reap certain dividends.

64 9.6 20050926p015001
he urged the government to invest more in solar energy research and provide incentives to encourage private investment in the field so that taiwan can develop a complete solar energy supply chain soon.

65 9.6 20050926p015002
cheng further said his company is expected to rank among the world's top five solar energy firms by 2008.

66 7.2 20050909p009001
"despite all of the concerns about imported oil and climate change, most people make their decision to install solar based on whether they're going to save money," said steven c. taub, director of emerging power generation technologies at cambridge energy research associates.

67 7.2 20050909p012002
last year, the solar industry produced 1,195 megawatts of new electricity-generation capacity, about the equivalent of one large power plant, taub said.

68 6.6 20051008p004002

"we're probably producing enough power to meet our demand for the day."

79 3.6 20051008p003002
a small black arrow pointed left, indicating that excess electricity was being sent back to the long island power authority.

80 3.6 20051008p006001
over the last year, demand "has skyrocketed" for these systems, said jonathan lane, who owns quad state solar, the company that installed the system for kubetz and burton.

81 3.6 20051008p007001
another sign that prices are going down and demand is increasing is the lower rebate offered by the power authority.

82 3.6 20051008p012002
there are also solar systems for heating water and pools.

83 3.6 20051008p013002
since most homes have their solar systems connected to the lipa grid, they draw energy back from the authority at night or on cloudy days, using the credits earned while supplying electricity during the day.

89 3.6 20051002p006002
for years, allen jones has used a solar oven for cooking.

90 3.6 20051002p007002
when he does, jones says, he won't hesitate to go solar.

91 3.6 20051002p008001
with energy costs on the rise, more and more people will be looking for ways to reduce their power bills, said jeff adolph of fresno.

92 3.6 20051002p013001
"in 2001, we were generating 10 megawatts of solar electricity in the state," he said.

93 3.6 20051002p014001
a megawatt is 1 million watts of electricity, or enough energy to power 300 homes.

94 3.6 20051002p015001
stout said there are some 500 solar electricity systems in operation in fresno and madera counties, up dramatically from a few years ago when there were just a handful of installations.

95 3.6 20050909p001002
the new interest means that the handful of domestic solar stocks has been surging, too.

96 3.6 20050909p003001
"the solar market is projected to grow 35 percent a year for the next three to five years," said walter v. nasdeo, managing director of ardour capital, an investment bank in new york that specializes in energy companies.

97 3.6 20050909p005001
until recently, the economics of the solar business did not tempt many consumers or investors.

98 3.6 20050909p006001
but government help, combined with the recent climb in energy prices, has made solar more appealing.

99 3.6 20050909p007003
homeowners typically connect their systems to the power grid and buy electricity when their panels do not produce enough power; they sell electricity to their utility when they have a surplus.
