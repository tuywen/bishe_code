[summary]:
touted as an antiterrorism measure, the "real id act" would also overturn laws in nine states that allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.
sensenbrenner's bill would compel states to add security features to all driver's licenses and create a license database that other states could access.
the real id act would require states to verify that people who apply for a driver's license are in the country legally.
proponents say the measure would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver's licenses which they could use to travel in the united states and would also stop terrorists from taking advantage of u.s. asylum laws.

[summary]:
the justices of the supreme court appeared to wrestle with contradictory impulses as they heard arguments on wednesday in two cases challenging government displays of the ten commandments.
scalia said he believed 90 percent of the american people supported having the ten commandments on display, even if ``85 percent of them couldn't tell you what they say.''
the us supreme court on wednesday  was to review the displaying in public spaces of the ten  commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of judeo-christian  religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of  church and state in american society.
scalia denounced the idea of "watering down" the religious message of the ten commandments, which he said was "government derives its authority from god," and suggested that it would be a "pyrrhic victory" if texas won on those grounds.

khan has made pakistan a nuclear power," said musharraf.
abdul qadeer khan, the father of the pakistani atomic bomb, delivered weapons grade highly enriched uranium to iran in 2001, and iran aims at getting a nuclear bomb next year, an iranian opposition group said in vienna wednesday.
u.s. intelligence and the u.n.'s vienna-based international atomic energy agency are trying to determine whether a. q. khan or iran, libya or north korea shared nuclear know-how with third parties, like al-qaida.
president bush met with musharraf on saturday and urged the pakistani general to make sure that all possible information about nuclear proliferation by the khan network be turned over to the americans.

colorado voters said much the same thing when they approved, over the vehement objections of most energy companies, a proposal mandating that 10 percent of the state's electricity must come from wind and solar power by 2015.
cape wind associates, the project's developer, says that in normal weather conditions, 40-story high towers could generate 170 megawatts -- 75 percent of the power used by cape cod and the islands of martha's vineyard and nantucket.
"this is great news for citizens hoping to turn decades of rhetoric into action on renewable energy," cape wind president jim gordon said, referring to the report's findings.

sandra day o'connor, the first  woman ever appointed to the us supreme court, said friday that she is retiring, giving us president george w. bush his first  opportunity to appoint a justice.
"the nation deserves and i will select a supreme court justice  that americans can be proud of," bush said.
ralph neas, president of people for the america way, said bush's nominee "is probably going to be either a judge or an academic with a lengthy record that is faithful to the record of a thomas or a scalia."
conservatives, who turned out in record numbers to cast votes  last november for the republican president, see in the retirement of  moderate justice sandra day o'connor a historic chance to reshape  the nine-member high court, and fulfill a fervent wish to overturn  the watershed roe v. wade supreme court case which guaranteed women  the right to an abortion.

police and investigators probing child molestation charges against superstar michael jackson on friday launched a fresh search on his famed neverland ranch, detectives said.
jackson's attorney steve cochran, in a motion filed oct. 8, accused sneddon of having a vendetta against jackson dating back to a 1993 molestation investigation that never resulted in charges being filed.
a judge thursday agreed to postpone the trial date for a lawsuit brought by michael jackson and his former lawyer over the alleged secret recording of them on a charter jet as the singer flew to be booked on child molestation charges.
a son of late acting legend marlon brando was implicated in an alleged plot by michael jackson to kidnap the boy who accused him of child molestation, a court heard friday.
jackson, freed on a 3-million-dollar bail, is scheduled to stand trial on jan. 31 on a 10-count indictment that charges him with child molestation and conspiracy to kidnap.

[summary]:
roads were clogged with rain and mud, and at least 720 crashes were reported sunday, more than three times the number of accidents during the previous sunday when streets were dry, the california highway patrol said.
a man died and another was injured in los angeles' elysian park  when a hillside collapsed and buried the two in the tent in which  they were sleeping on saturday night, officials said.
at least three or four people were pulled alive from the debris over the course of the day, including a woman in the early evening who was "pretty seriously injured," eric nishimoto, a spokesman for the ventura county sheriff's department, said.
the rain caused a hillside to give way in the 6200 block of gyral drive in sunland, damaging a home and prompting authorities to evacuate five people from three residences, humphrey said.

the irish and british governments hope for an answer before the  august holiday period from the ira, which declared a ceasefire in  its campaign to end british rule in northern ireland ahead of a 1998  good friday peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.
britain expects an "imminent" statement  from the ira as to whether the northern irish paramilitary group is  to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a  government minister said monday.
the pair would meet at the house of commons on wednesday,  officials in dublin said, with ahern also holding talks with ian  paisley, leader of northern ireland's biggest protestant political  group, the democratic unionist party (dup).
protestant factions in northern ireland are adamant that there  can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement  without a move by the ira to end all criminal and paramilitary  activity.

apple's computers are now installed with powerpc  microprocessors from ibm, which are different in design from the  popular x-86 chips of intel and amd.
in a risky move that could further shrink its minuscule slice of the pc market, apple computer inc. announced plans monday to switch its macintosh computers to the same intel corp. chips used in systems that run microsoft windows.
"it's been 10 years since our transition to the powerpc, and we think intel's technology will help us create the best personal  computers for the next 10 years," said steve jobs, apple's ceo.
steven p. jobs is preparing to take an unprecedented gamble by abandoning apple computer's 14-year commitment to chips developed by ibm and motorola in favor of intel processors for his macintosh computers, industry executives informed of the decision said sunday.

[summary]:
using the simmons case, the u.s. supreme court will hear arguments wednesday on whether it is constitutional to execute killers who were juveniles when the crimes were committed.
the missouri supreme court last year upheld the conviction but threw out the death sentence, saying that to execute someone for crimes committed before reaching age 18 would be cruel and unusual in light of current societal standards.
nixon, pressing missouri's appeal to the justices, assails that ruling as violating the u.s. supreme court's still valid decision from 1989 that executing 17 year olds is permissible.
yet in the 2002 opinion, written by stevens, the court seemed to warn that it was not ready for that, contrasting the strong trend against executing the retarded with the fact that, between 1989 and 2002, only two states had raised their death penalty ages to 18.

even before merck pulled vioxx from the market on sept. 30, citing what it said was new evidence that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other serious ailments, hundreds of patients had filed lawsuits around the country.
the pharmaceutical firm merck faces a new class-action lawsuit in canada, filed on behalf of two people who suffered heart attacks after taking the company's pain medication vioxx, which was taken off the market worldwide because of such risks, plaintiffs' lawyers said friday.
the european medicines agency is to review all drugs in the same class as vioxx after us pharmaceutical giant merck withdrew the arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said friday.
last month, merck had said the vioxx recall would slash 50 cents to 60 cents off its earnings per share for the year; on thursday, it said the impact would be 50 cents to 55 cents.

"i understand why a $6,000 shower curtain seems indefensible," kozlowski, tyco's former chief executive, said on the eve of his retrial on charges of looting the company.
former top executives l. dennis kozlowski and mark swartz are awaiting retrial in federal court in new york on charges of stealing $600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company.
in the first trial, which ended in a mistrial, at least one juror said she was planning to acquit the men because she could not find that the defendants had criminal intent.
the two former top executives of tyco international ltd. stole $150 million from the industrial conglomerate even though they were among the highest-paid people in corporate america, a prosecutor told jurors as their retrial began wednesday.

for one thing, he said, the audience could not possibly get the jokes if it did not already know the news stories that were being spoofed.
surrounded by a throng of reporters at heathrow airport on thursday, islam said it was ludicrous that he's on washington's no-fly list, suspected of ties to terrorists, and said he would challenge the decision to block him from entering the country.
"i request you, in the name of allah ... to release the british citizen ken bigley for the good name of our religion and according to the sayings of allah in the glorious quran," said islam, who was taken off a washington-bound plane last month and expelled from the united states after his name turned up on a list of people suspected of having terrorist links.
us authorities diverted a washington-bound air france flight after discovering that a passenger was part of a "no-fly" list of people deemed a security risk, a us security official said sunday.

one of fischer's supporters in iceland said the japanese government had confirmed it would allow him to go to iceland if citizenship was granted.
chess legend bobby fischer was on  monday granted citizenship by the parliament of iceland, a move  which could allow him to avoid deportation from japan to the united  states where he is wanted for violating sanctions against the former  yugoslavia.
mizuho fukushima, leader of japan's opposition social democratic party, said senior immigration officials told her that fischer would be allowed to go to iceland if he is given citizenship there.
iceland's parliament voted monday to grant icelandic citizenship to the american chess champion bobby fischer, laying the groundwork, his supporters said, for his release from the japanese prison where he has been detained since last summer.

alberto r. gonzales, the white house counsel, intervened directly with justice department lawyers in 2002 to obtain a legal ruling on the extent of the president's authority to permit extreme interrogation practices in the name of national security, current and former administration officials said tuesday.
``what the administration is saying is we're not going to torture people,'' said john c. yoo, a university of california, berkeley law professor who as a deputy assistant attorney general during bush's first term worked on torture policies.
``the last thing you'd want to do is publicly disclose how you interrogate people, because it would allow them to prepare their people to resist interrogations,'' yoo said.

last year, the solar industry produced 1,195 megawatts of new electricity-generation capacity, about the equivalent of one large power plant, taub said.
neely said that with the possibility of a solar power system paying for itself in fewer years, given the current energy price situation, he and his wife, nola, are seriously considering installing photovoltaic roof panels on their next house.
but today, with 560 homes and businesses powered by solar energy on long island, the lipa rebate is down to $4 per watt, and the utility expects to lower it further to $3.75 in mid- to late 2006 if solar system prices continue to go down, said daniel zaweski, the director of energy efficiency and distributed generation programs at the power authority.
in the past two years, cheng said, more and more local companies have got involved in solar energy development, enhancing the possibility of forming a comprehensive industry supply chain.

on wednesday, singh, the indian leader, expressed a commitment to make peace with pakistan, while islamabad hailed india's withdrawal of some of india's troops in kashmir _ a move hoped to spur the peace process.
when the british pulled out of the subcontinent in august 1947, they told the indian princes, including the hindu maharajah who ruled the mainly muslim territory of jammu and kashmir, to choose between joining india or pakistan.
india's prime minister will  personally flag off the first bus to travel between the indian and  pakistan zones of divided kashmir in almost six decades when the  service resumes next month, an official said saturday.
farooq said hurriyat leaders would travel to new delhi next week to meet pakistan's prime minister shaukat aziz, who is expected to discuss new efforts to advance a peace process that began last year.

three explosions shook three egyptian red sea resorts popular with vacationing israelis on thursday night, killing at least 35 people and wounding about 100, according to officials from egypt, israel and nearby hospitals.
"we know dozens of israelis have been killed," an israeli police source said after a massive explosion devastated the vast hilton hotel in taba at the main border crossing point between egypt and israel.
a suspected car bomb ripped through a hotel on the red sea coast of egypt's sinai desert late thursday, one of three explosions targeting israelis that left at least 30 people dead and scores more wounded.
israel will help evacuate any of the 12,000 to 15,000 israelis who wish to leave egypt's sinai peninsula in the wake of several deadly explosions, an israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said friday.

[summary]:
the frisbee-shaped huygens probe successfully separated from the cassini spacecraft friday and began a risky 2.5-million-mile journey to the surface of saturn's bizarre, smog-choked moon titan.
whatever it does will have to happen quickly: if huygens lands successfully, probably somewhere near titan's equator, it will have no more than two hours to study the moon's surface before its only link to earth -- cassini -- disappears over the horizon.
then, as the huygens probe falls toward the top of titan's perceptible atmosphere, 789 miles above the surface, its two transmitters, each with its own antenna, will signal its progress to cassini, and the orbiter will record the messages for later transmission to earth.
that data won't come for another three weeks, during which time the 9-foot-diameter huygens probe will chase down titan and then, if everything goes as planned, hurl itself through the thick, nitrogen-methane atmosphere before crashing into a surface that could consist of anything from a sticky chemical sludge to poison oceans.

ten people were killed and  more than 100 injured wednesday when two commuter trains slammed  into each other after one of them hit a car left on the lines by a  suicidal man, police said.
several train passengers said they saw alvarez jump from his suv just before the southbound train plowed into the vehicle, adams said.
a "deranged" man abandoned his suv on railroad tracks when he aborted a suicide attempt, authorities said, and then watched as a metrolink commuter train slammed into it, setting off a spectacular three-train collision that left at 11 least dead and more than 180 injured wednesday.
"he exited the vehicle and stood  by as a southbound metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the  train to derail and strike the northbound train," the police chief  said.

lawyers were set to begin crucial final arguments tuesday in the case of two sikh immigrants from india accused of the 1985 mid-air bombing of an air india plane which left 329 people dead.
the prosecution began final arguments monday in the case of an air india jumbo jet bombing that killing 329 people almost 20 years ago, saying the two men accused in the canadian trial were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
prosecutors believe malik and bagri were part of a conspiracy by british columbia-based sikh extremists to take revenge against the indian government, which owns air india planes, for attacking a sikh temple in 1984.
with the trial of bagri and malik now over, it's past time for an inquiry into the bombings, said perviz madon, whose husband sam, a college professor, died aboard air india on june 23, 1985.

the early stages of american  adventurer steve fossett's bid to make the first solo non-stop  flight around the world without refueling aboard the globalflyer  have gone "exactly as planned", organizers said.
fossett, who took off from here in the virgin atlantic  globalflyer on monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and  80 hours, said he had to deal with a number of "dramas" during  takeoff but the flight was going well overall.
"i'm a bit nervous about takeoff," said fossett, 60, who has logged about 30 hours in the jet-powered aircraft.
having already shattered records in a hot-air balloon and a glider, fossett hopes to soon become the first to make a solo, nonstop flight around the world without refueling.

i want the troops home," cindy sheehan, 48, of california, who staged a protest that she vowed on sunday to continue until she can personally ask bush: "why did you kill my son?
two senior white house aides met here on saturday with the angry mother of a fallen u.s. soldier, but they rejected cindy sheehan's demand for a direct accounting from president bush for the way he has conducted the war in iraq.
as a roadside anti-war vigil initiated by a california woman who lost a son in iraq continued near his ranch thursday, president bush said that he sympathizes with her loss but that agreeing to her demand to immediately withdraw troops ``would be a mistake for the security of this country.''
but, sheehan said, she has no plans to end her vigil until bush meets with her to discuss the war, he goes back to the white house or she is arrested.

a suicide bomber wearing an  explosives belt walked up to an iraqi polling station on saturday  and set off a blast that killed a child and seven adults, including  three soldiers, said police and the us military.
four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power  station in the southern baghdad neighbourhood of dura, while an  iraqi soldier and a policeman were killed in separate attacks in  samarra and kirkuk

peter jennings, the last of the three long-dominant network anchors still on the job, said tuesday he has been diagnosed with lung cancer.
e-mail messages released tuesday by jennings and abc news president david westin stressed that jennings, who is 66 and who has anchored abc's "world news tonight" since 1983, will continue to work during treatment, provided he feels well enough.
in his own e-mail to his colleagues, jennings said: "there will be good days and bad, which means that some days i may be cranky and some days really cranky!
abc news president david westin told the network's staff that he and jennings expect the anchor to continue the newscast during his treatment ``to the extent he can do so comfortably.''

the expos played their first regular-season game against the mets in 1969 and their last game against the mets on oct. 3, so it was only fitting that the washington nationals would play their first game against the mets on opening day in the grapefruit league.
the white house said thursday it hoped that the city of washington and major league baseball could still reach an agreement that would bring a professional team to the us capital city.
the nationals' home opener on april 14 would be the first regular season major league game in the city since the senators left to become the texas rangers after the 1971 season.
major league baseball on wednesday rejected as "wholly unacceptable" a stadium financing plan approved the day before by the washington city council, throwing into grave doubt the city's plans to bring the former montreal expos here next season.

more than 7,000  hurricane katrina survivors taking refuge in texas shelters were  being uprooted again tuesday as hurricane rita threatened the state  neighboring louisiana, officials said.
hurricane rita barreled near southern florida islands and headed  toward the gulf of mexico, threatening texas and louisiana with  winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph).
hurricane rita brushed past key west on tuesday and was forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane later in the week, prompting residents and rescuers to begin evacuating this feeble city, as well as parts of louisiana and texas.
we've already evacuated two busloads of  individuals," nagin said as rita barreled near southernmost florida,  heading west on a track that could take it close to the devastated  louisiana city.

many britons welcomed prince charles' surprise announcement that he would marry his lover camilla parker bowles, but some said she never will win their hearts the way princess diana did.
charles and camilla _ divorcees and longtime lovers _ will marry in a civil ceremony, not in the church of england, and that parker bowles will be called her royal highness the duchess of cornwall after the marriage, and called the princess consort, not the queen, when charles becomes king.
in a surprise announcement, britain's heir to the throne, prince charles, declared on thursday that he will marry his lover, camilla parker bowles, in a spring ceremony at windsor castle.
even officials of the church of england, which until 2002 did not even allow divorcees to marry in church, have come around to the idea that charles and camilla would be better off married than not.

"i definitely think they should allow white people in as members," campfield said.
"i think she's very upset with herself, maybe, for being a judge and putting her family in this danger," said laura lefkow, 20, the third of the judge's five daughters, "but there's no way she should have known."
"very typically these days we see white supremacists, hate groups, trying to use the words of king and other civil rights leaders to try to advance their agendas," potok said.
local and federal law enforcement officials said on tuesday that they were investigating possible connections between the double murder and matthew hale, the white supremacist currently in federal prison for soliciting lefkow's assassination, or his many sympathizers.

his study suggests that the epigenome may be involved in many diseases that can affect identical twins differently, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and cancer.
(the same test, known as a dna biopsy, might also be used in adults and children with schizophrenia to find genes that are damaged and then select the best therapy for them, similar to the way herceptin is used in breast cancer and gleevec is used for leukemia.)
vaughan carr of the neuroscience institute of schizophrenia and  allied disorders said the discovery could provide a better  understanding of the genetic causes of the illness and eventually  lead to improved treatments.
in an editorial last year in the journal neurology, sirven said the best studies of marijuana's effects on humans so far have shown little objective evidence of benefit in patients with epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.

"maybe we'll come up with a fine or a tax for the plastic bags, and give the bag some value, so people will think twice before throwing it on the streets."
shestek, the american plastics council spokesman, said some of the costs attributed to plastic bags could be recouped by sending plastic bag waste to companies that can use it as a raw material, such as decking and composite lumber producers.
it's probably faster to use a lot of bags instead of trying to figure out how to make the best use of each bag, but it's so wasteful," says sarah stockton of daly city.
my column explained that the san francisco department of the environment came up with the 17 cents by dividing the environmental cost of used grocery bags ($8.5 million annually) by the estimated number of plastic and paper bags distributed in san francisco supermarkets each year (50 million).

``i never set out to write a book to change women's lives, to change history,'' said friedan, who always kept a sense of wonder about her place in history as the mother of the contemporary women's movement.
i came to realize,'' friedan later wrote, ``that something is very wrong with the way american women are trying to live their lives today.
friedan's cousin, emily bazelon, said: ``her feminism was an aspect of her humanism, and she really cared about the economic well-being of families and of all people,'' bazelon said saturday.
though in later years, some feminists dismissed friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today -- from unisex help wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.

the united states said tuesday it was  "deeply troubled" by an apparent setback to democracy in nepal,  where king gyanendra has dismissed the government and imposed a  state of emergency.
muni, a former indian ambassador to nepal, said beijing has become increasingly concerned by growing u.s.-nepal ties, which the government of prime minister sher bahadur deuba _ dismissed by gyanendra on tuesday _ had actively sought.
king gyanendra shared prime minister shaukat aziz's  disappointment over the postponement of the saarc summit and  expressed full confidence in pakistan to set up new dates for the  summit and assured that he would certainly come to represent nepal at the summit, the spokesman said.

"we need to find ways to make renewable fuels and nuclear power more competitive, and to get these coal plants to start sequestering co2, and to develop a clean hydrogen fuel system and do a lot of other things," he said.
socolow said a 1,000-megawatt coal plant would produce about 50 million barrels of supercritical carbon dioxide per year.
bp said the project, which would make use of a power station in northern scotland and export the carbon dioxide to a north sea oil reservoir, would require total capital investment of some us$600 million (euro497 million).
lowe, the ge executive, estimated that capturing carbon would add about 25 percent to the cost of electricity from a combined-cycle plant burning gasified coal, but that it would add 70 percent to the price of power from conventional plants.

both the united states and the european union think mainland china's planned anti-secession legislation is counterproductive to peace across the taiwan strait, minister of foreign affairs tan sun chen said monday.
mainland china is pushing taiwan to decide through a referendum whether to "separate from the mainland" if it makes the "one country, two systems" or "one china" principle a part of its proposed anti-secession law, mainland affairs council chairman joseph wu said tuesday.
chen said that beijing has been actively engaging in "psychological, legal and media warfare" in pushing to enact the anti-secession law, which he said is aimed at establishing a legal justification for a military invasion of taiwan.

[summary]:
some opponents also have argued that easier access to the morning-after pill would make teens more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior _ though some doctors say that research done at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine casts doubt on that argument.
the findings led the study authors to conclude that easy access to plan b, also called the morning-after pill, could cut the number of unwanted pregnancies while posing no apparent risk to women.
because medical experts do not consider a woman to be pregnant until after an egg implants into the uterus, the morning-after pill is not considered abortion, although some conservatives object to any interference with a fertilized egg.
the medical profession does not consider emergency contraception to be an abortion pill like ru-486, or mifeprex, because plan b works by preventing a pregnancy from starting rather than ending an existing one.
