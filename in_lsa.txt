38.5885011494 13 i've used it around town and find it to be extremely accurate .

38.4025861883 43 i used it the day i bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  the only downfall of this product, and the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .

38.3698045765 14 it has yet to disappoint, getting me everywhere with 100% accuracy .
38.3669016948 33 the only glitch i have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the gps, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .

38.2358891489 24 my new garmin 255w had very easy set up, accurate directions to locations, user friendly unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .
38.2102229723 35 i'm really glad i bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .
38.1927243325 19 it provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle .
38.1892745695 24 i've used other gps units, as well as gps built into cars   and to this day nothing beats the accuracy of a garmin gps .

38.1144649638 27 while the 255w routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use i discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .
38.0839195278 17 i updated to the latest 2010 map soon after i received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .
37.8233459317 15 ,  very accurate but with one small glitch i found ,  i'll explain in the cons
