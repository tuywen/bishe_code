these include "clean" coal and carbon sequestration, in which  carbon dioxide gas is pumped into geological chambers and stored  there, rather than released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels  are burned in power stations.

plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxide and can be combined with a futuristic option called "carbon sequestration," in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected into oil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.
