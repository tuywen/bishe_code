the european-built space probe huygens separated from its nasa mothership late friday to begin a descent to saturn's largest moon titan, during which it will sample the atmosphere of titan.
[2] diversity: 1.0 tol_words: 52 sen_len: 24
then, as the huygens probe falls toward the top of titan's perceptible atmosphere, 789 miles above the surface, its two transmitters, each with its own antenna, will signal its progress to cassini, and the orbiter will record the messages for later transmission to earth.
[3] diversity: 0.75 tol_words: 57 sen_len: 30
that data won't come for another three weeks, during which time the 9-foot-diameter huygens probe will chase down titan and then, if everything goes as planned, hurl itself through the thick, nitrogen-methane atmosphere before crashing into a surface that could consist of anything from a sticky chemical sludge to poison oceans.

one prominent environmental group, the natural resources defense council in washington, has estimated that the extra cost of using igcc and carbon sequestration in all plants being built in developing nations would be just $6 billion a year.
[3] diversity: 0.75 tol_words: 44 sen_len: 28
plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxide and can be combined with a futuristic option called "carbon sequestration," in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected into oil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.

these include "clean" coal and carbon sequestration, in which  carbon dioxide gas is pumped into geological chambers and stored  there, rather than released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels  are burned in power stations.
